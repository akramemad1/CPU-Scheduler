# CPU-Scheduler
This project is a graphical CPU scheduling simulator designed for demonstration purposes. It supports dynamic process addition, time execution, and multiple scheduling algorithms. Users can visualize how different algorithms manage CPU time, track process statistics, and compare performance in real-time.
